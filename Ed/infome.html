			<p class="me" >Edward T. Cain is the former Director of Operations of the Ohio Council of Retail Merchants and Distribution Executive at Lazarus, Value City, Ames Department Stores  and Emporium Capwell. He also served on the Ohio Board of Pharmacy as the Public Member, having initially appointed by Governor Ted Strickland and subsequently by Governor John Kasich.

			Throughout his life he has seen homlessness encase the cities of New York, Chicago, San Diego, and Columbus. He found that the most devistating of the detriments that plague the homless has been the weather, specifically the harsher winter months. In an effort to change the way the homeless he began the Hoodies for the Homeless project to bring warmth to the community taking no monetary compensation for his efforts. Ed hopes this project inspires others around the world to create a project of their own.
